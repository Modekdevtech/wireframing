## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating simplified, low-fidelity visual guides that outline the structure, layout, and hierarchy of an interface or page. Think of a wireframe as the blueprint for a digital product — it shows where elements go, how users will navigate, and which features exist, without the distraction of final visuals like colors, typography, or imagery.

## Why wireframing matters

* **Saves time and cost:** Catch layout and usability problems early before high-fidelity design or development begins.
* **Clarifies structure:** Helps stakeholders and teams agree on content priorities and information flow.
* **Improves collaboration:** Designers, product managers, and developers can iterate quickly on ideas.
* **Focuses on user needs:** Encourages testing of layout and functionality before visual polish.

## Types of wireframes

* **Low-fidelity:** Simple sketches or grayscale layouts that show placement and hierarchy.
* **Mid-fidelity:** More precise spacing and layout, sometimes including placeholder content and annotations.
* **High-fidelity wireframes / detailed wireframes:** Detailed layouts with exact spacing, component placement, and notes for handoff (but still without final visual styling).

## Common tools

* Paper & pen (fast and flexible)
* Figma
* Sketch
* Adobe XD
* Balsamiq
* Axure

## Best practices

1. Start with user goals and tasks — design for what the user needs to accomplish.
2. Keep it simple: focus on layout and flow, not colors or final imagery.
3. Annotate important interactions and assumptions.
4. Iterate quickly and validate with stakeholders or simple usability tests.
5. Use consistent spacing and components to make wireframes easier to turn into prototypes.
